So one of the use cases I am interested in is sequence Classification. I like the idea that i could train a system to see pattens in numbers over time. It has a ton of helpful uses:

* Monitoring
* Self Healing systems
* Investing

So its one of the key areas I plan to spend some time Learning about.
