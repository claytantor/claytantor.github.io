I really wanted to test that my ci scripts for the site worked, and that I could easily
create new posts. This is an experiment I am trying to verify that I can update and change
this site completely in the cloud.

# Advice to the Founders
Remember that if you *show no mercy* and are telling users that they are *wasting your time* that you are very likely alienating a potential customer. My honest recommendation is that you try to be more of a servant and expect that people are going to not meet your expectations, and instead of criticizing them help them with compassion and kindness. If you can't do it because your personality doesn't permit it, hire someone who can and don't be customer facing. Wether you want to admit it or not you are killing deals before they ever begin.
