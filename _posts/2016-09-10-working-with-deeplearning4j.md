I admit it. I am ignorant. I also am not a wizard, information doesn't just get injected into my brain as if I was neo from the matrix. **I know kungfu**.
So its normal to ask dumb questions or misunderstand when coming to something new and fresh. That's where I am coming from with this post in my first impressions and issues I am seeing around using **deeplearning4j**.

Most enterprise companies understand this and spend a ton of time, money and energy on building documentation, cookbooks and how-tos that make understanding the essentials of how a technology is used for end to end use cases possible.

The commercial company behind **deeplearning4j** is [skymind](https://skymind.io/). It positions itself as "Deep Learning for Enterprise Level Applications", which is and important claim because enterprise is not focused on science, or mathematics, its focused on business impact. Business concerns are different than academic ones and as a set of technologies like this transition from primarily academic settings to commercial ones the product owner should spend time and have concern for.

This post is about my experiences in the first week of using deeplearning4j, the challenges I faced and my experiences.

* [All deeplearning4j Repos](https://github.com/deeplearning4j) - This is all the repos related to deeplearning4j, including the examples.
* [ND4j Repo On Github](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j) - ND4J is the mathematics foundation classes used by deeplearning4j.  
* [Andy Gibson's Glitter](https://gitter.im/agibsonccc) - *Newbie's beware.* Ask the wrong question to the group and Andy will start a DM with you and tell you that you are wasting his time. I found that AlexDBlack was helpful even though I asked him one very dumb question.

## Classification
I would argue that a giant business use cases is about automation of classification. Making simple data structures that make it easy to build recordsets, and then to simply get the classifications for those records automatically is important to broad adoption.

When trying to use **deeplearning4j** I ran into some specific challenges that slowed me down.
